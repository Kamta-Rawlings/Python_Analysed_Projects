QUESTION
For a circle of radius r, display the diameter, circumference and area.
Use the value 3.14159 for "pie".
Use the following formulas (r is the radius):
diameter = 2 * r
Circumference = 2 * p * r
area = p * (r ** 2) and
Use the input function to read the value of radius from the user
and print the output in the following format:
" diameter = 8
circumference = 25.13272
area = 50.26544 "
'''
r = int(input("Pleaase Enter the radius: "))
p = 3.14159
diameter = 2 * r
Circumference = 2 * p * r
area = p * (r ** 2)
print(f'diameter = {diameter}\ncircumference = {Circumference}\
\narea = {area}')

'''
The main challenge here was producing the output as stated,
and donot over think things or complete your solution.
diameter = 8
circumference = 25.13272
area = 50.26544
