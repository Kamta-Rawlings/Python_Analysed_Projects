# Python Tutorial Series – Chapter 1

Welcome to **Chapter 1: Introduction** of the Python Tutorial Series! 🎉🐍

This README covers a collection of beginner-level Python exercises from the **UHasselt Python Course (Master in Data Science)**. Each exercise focuses on building confidence with Python basics through clear, practical examples.

The goal of this chapter is to help you:
- Understand core Python syntax
- Practice writing clean, simple code
- Learn step-by-step problem solving
- Explore multiple ways to solve the same problem

> 💡 **Note:** There are many possible ways to solve each problem. The solutions in this repository are just one approach.
