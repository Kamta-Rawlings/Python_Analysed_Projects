# Python Tutorial Series – Chapter 2

Welcome to **Chapter 2: Conditions, Looping & Iteration** of the Python Tutorial Series! 🔁🐍  
This chapter introduces some of the most important concepts in programming:

> **Making decisions (conditions) and repeating actions (loops).**

Through these exercises—from the UHasselt Python Course (Master in Data Science)—you will learn how to control the flow of your Python programs and solve problems step by step.

The goals of this chapter are to:

- Understand and write **conditional statements**
- Work with **loops** (`for` and `while`)
- Practice **unbounded iteration**
- Strengthen algorithmic and logical thinking
- Apply iteration to strings, numbers, and mathematical formulas

> 💡 **Note:** There is no single “correct” solution. The examples provided are clear and beginner-friendly, but many other valid approaches exist.

## 📘 Chapter 2 – Conditions, Loops & Iteration

Below is the list of tutorial exercises included in this chapter:

---

### **(3.01) Conditionals – Evaluate Boolean Statements**
- Practice truth values and boolean logic.
- Understand `and`, `or`, and `not`.
- Learn how Python evaluates complex conditions.

---

### **(3.06) Conditions & Unbounded Iteration – Separating Digits (Enhanced)**
- Separate digits from an integer of *any* length.
- Use a `while` loop and conditions together.
- No assumptions about how many digits the number has.

---

### **(3.7) Conditionals – Leap Year**
- Determine whether a given year is a leap year.
- Combine multiple boolean conditions correctly.

---

### **(2.01) Looping – Number of Steps**
- Use loops to simulate repeated operations.
- Understand counters and iterative logic.

---

### **(2.02) Looping – Printing a List of Numbers**
- Print sequences using a `for` loop.
- Understand how iteration over ranges works.

---

### **(2.8) Looping – Write Matrix**
- Use **nested loops** to construct a matrix-like output.
- Practice looping inside another loop.

---

### **(2.9a) Looping – Calculate Sum**
- Compute the total of several numbers.
- Learn accumulator patterns in loops.

---

### **(2.10) Looping – Binomial Coefficient**
- Implement the binomial coefficient using loops.
- Strengthen logic involving multiplication and iteration.

---

### **(3.11a) Iteration – Reverse String**
- Reverse a string manually.
- Practice indexing and character-by-character traversal.

---

### **(3.12a) Iteration – Count Letters**
- Count how many times a character appears in a string.
- Build your own version of Python’s `count()`.

---

### **(3.12b) Iteration – Anagram**
- Determine if two words are anagrams.
- Use looping to compare letter counts or sorted characters.

---

## 🧠 Learning Philosophy

Just like in Chapter 1:

> ✨ **Programming has many correct solutions.**

You’re encouraged to:

- Try different loop types  
- Rewrite solutions using conditions instead of built-ins  
- Explore both simple and efficient approaches  

This builds strong logic and problem-solving skills.
