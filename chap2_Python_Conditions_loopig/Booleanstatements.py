QUESTION
Give the value these boolean expressions (true/false) evaluate to:
'''
a = 3 == 3  # comparison
b = 3 != 3  # not equal to
c = 3 >= 4  # greater than or equal to
d = not (3 < 4)  # less than
e = not (3 >= 4) or 2 < 3  # using the or comparison
f = not ((3 >= 4) or 2 < 3)  # using 'not' comparison after doing the bracket
print(str(a).lower())
print(str(b).lower())
print(str(c).lower())
print(str(d).lower())
print(str(e).lower())
print(str(f).lower())

'''
In this chapter you learn how to use boolean comparison
and  results 'true' or 'false' is converted to a string and coverted to lower
